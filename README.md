## Introduction

The Crop Recommendation System assists farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions about crop selection. By analyzing key factors such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall, the system suggests the most appropriate crops to cultivate, aiming to enhance yield and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Features

- **Predictive Analysis**: Recommends suitable crops based on input parameters.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Accessible via a web application for ease of use.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended with additional features and datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Flask
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset

The system utilizes a dataset containing various parameters influencing crop growth, including:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH Level
- Rainfall

*Note*: Ensure the dataset (`Crop_recommendation.csv`) is placed in the project directory.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nageswari2004/crop_recommendation_system.git
